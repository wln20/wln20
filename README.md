- 🌱 Hi! I'm Luning Wang, currently a Master's student at the University of Michigan. Before that, I got my B.Eng. degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University.
- 📖 I mainly focused on infrastructure and efficiency optimization of Large Language Models (a.k.a MLSys or AI-Infra) in my past research, including the compression and acceleration techniques of LLMs. Aside from that, I also have some experiences on Biomedical LLMs and Multimodal LLMs. See my <a href='https://wln20.github.io'>Homepage</a> and <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/wangluning/'>LinkedIn</a> to learn more about me.
- 🤝 I'm open to discussion & collaboration. Feel free to chat with me!
