- 🌱 Hi! I'm Luning Wang, currently a Master's student at the University of Michigan. Before that, I did my undergrad at the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University.
- 📖 I mainly focused on the infrastructure and efficiency optimization of Large Language Models (a.k.a MLSys or AI-Infra) in my past works. Aside from that, I’m also learning related AI techs like RL and Multimodal/Diffusion Models. See my <a href='https://wln20.github.io'>Homepage</a> and <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/wangluning/'>LinkedIn</a> to learn more about me.
- 🤝 I'm open to discussion & collaboration. Feel free to chat with me!
